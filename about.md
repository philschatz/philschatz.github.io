I'm an open source developer making free textbooks by day and forcing GitHub to create textbooks by night.

If you're interested, my code is at [github/philschatz](https://github.com/philschatz) and [github/Connexions](https://github.com/Connexions) or drop me an email at `phil$cnx.org` (replace `$` with `@`).
