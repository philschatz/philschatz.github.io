## CSS Diffs

Our textbooks are frequently hundreds of pages long and use a single CSS file, so making a CSS change can change content in unexpected places.

Again, [CSS Polyfills](/css-polyfills.js/) and a little XSLT file makes this easy.

[CSS-Diff](https://github.com/philschatz/css-diff.js) takes an HTML and CSS file and produces an HTML file with all the styling "baked" in.
Then, the provided XSLT file can compare 2 "baked" HTML files and inject `<span>` tags whenever the styles differ.


See the [CSS-Diff](https://github.com/philschatz/css-diff.js) project to run it from the commandline.
