[octokit.js](https://github.com/philschatz/octokit.js) is a JavaScript client that interacts with GitHub using their API. Try it out with the **[interactive demo](/octokit.js/demo/)**!

Some unique features:

- works in a browser or in NodeJS
- uses [Promises](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)
- written in CoffeeScript
- Mocha unit tests that actually talk to GitHub (and run in the browser or commandline)
- Code Coverage using BlanketJS (that runs in the browser or commandline)
- supports [Harmony Generators](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators)

API Support:

- all repo operations (including create/remove)
- Teams, Organizations, and Permissions
- eTags for caching results
- Notifications for rate limit changes
- Committing multiple files at once

Finding a test and coverage framework that works both in a browser and on the commandline was a bit challenging but I'll return to that in another post.

This library also uses `jQuery.ajax` and `jQuery.Deferred`.
