## Octokit.js

[Octokit.js](https://github.com/philschatz/octokit.js) is a JavaScript client that interacts with GitHub using their API.

Some unique features:

- works in a browser or in NodeJS
- uses [Promises](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)
- written in CoffeeScript
- Mocha unit tests that actually talk to GitHub (and run in the browser or commandline)
- Code Coverage using BlanketJS (that runs in the browser or commandline)

API Support:

- all repo operations (including create/remove)
- Teams, Ogniations, and Permisions
- eTags for caching results
- Listeners on rate limit changes
- Committing multiple files at once

Finding a test and coverage framework that works both in a browser and on the commandline was a bit challenging but I'll return to that in another post.

This library also uses `jQuery.ajax` and `jQuery.Deferred`.
