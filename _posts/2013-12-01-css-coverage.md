title: CSS Coverage for Javascript Unit Tests
tags: css
---

There are many CSS coverage projects but none plug **directly into JS unit tests**, instrumenting at the same time as the JavaScript coverage.

Assuming you have BlanketJS and Mocha tests, just grab **[css-coverage.js](https://github.com/philschatz/css-coverage.js)** and add the following into the test harness HTML file :

    <link rel="stylesheet/coverage" href="path/to/file.less" />
    <script src="css-coverage.js"></script>

## Less.js + Mocha + BlanketJS

The coverage script uses the `less.tree` AST to parse all the selectors and the `debugInfo` data to get line numbers. It adds a `testdone` hook to Mocha that runs all the selectors on the page. Then, the line number and coverage counts are given to BlanketJS so LESS/CSS files are included in the coverage report.
