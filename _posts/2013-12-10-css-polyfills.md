I often hear "CSS is meant to style and HTML should describe content", but CSS alone is not enough to make textbooks.

Sometimes you need to:

1. style an element based on what's inside (notes containing a title)
2. change link text based on the target (`See Figure 2a` vs `See Table 4.3`)
3. move elements somewhere else in the book (answers to the back)

Well, now there is [css-polyfills.js](/css-polyfills.js/), based on some great [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/) [specs](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-gcpm/), [Sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com), and [selector-set](https://github.com/josh/selector-set).


## Examples (from Bootstrap)

With [css-polyfills.js](/css-polyfills.js/) you can do things that are not possible using CSS in browsers. Bootstrap's [Dismissable Alerts](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts-dismissable) require adding a special class on the alert if it contains a close button. This can be accomplished without adding the `alert-dismissable` class by using `:has`:

    .alert:has(> .close) { /* Styles for `.alert-dismissable` */ }

Bootstrap [Modals](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals) and [Input Groups](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#input-groups-buttons) require adding wrapper elements in order to style properly; with nested `::before` and `::outside` these are unnecessary.

You can construct the 2 additional elements (`.modal`, `.modal-dialog`) around `.modal-content` using the following CSS:

    .modal-content                  { ... }
    .modal-content::outside         { /* Styles for `.modal-dialog` */}
    .modal-content::outside::outside{ /* Styles for `.modal` */ }

You can even style links depending on the target:

    a[href^="#"] {
      // Use target-is as a guard for which link text to use
      content: target-is(attr(href), 'figure')   'See Figure';
      content: target-is(attr(href), 'table')    'See Table';
      content: target-is(attr(href), '.example') 'See Example';
    }

Or, you can move elements down the page (ie collate footnotes at the bottom of a wikipedia article):

    .footnote { move-to: footnotes-area; }
    #footnotes {
      content: pending(footnotes-area);
    }

Of course, there's much more that can be accomplished using [css-polyfills.js](/css-polyfills.js); check the [README.md](https://github.com/philschatz/css-polyfills.js) for more details.
